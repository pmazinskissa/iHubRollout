- **Sampling Validation:** Monthly review of 10% of reported savings with task reconstruction
- **System Inference:** Platform usage patterns correlated with deliverable timestamps

**Quality Assessment**
- **Blind Review Protocol:** Random sample of deliverables rated by senior reviewers without AI-usage disclosure
- **Before/After Comparison:** Matched pairs analysis on similar deliverable types
- **Client Feedback Integration:** Structured questions in engagement close-out surveys

**Business Impact Calculation**
- **Margin Analysis:** Compare project margins for AI-enabled vs. comparable non-AI engagements (controlling for complexity, duration, practice area)

## Appendix E: Process Reengineering Agent Architecture

### Overview

The Process Reengineering Agent is SSA & Co.'s flagship multi-agent, multi-step orchestrated system designed to accelerate and enhance process analysis, optimization recommendations, and deliverable generation for client engagements. This agent exemplifies SSA's approach to full-spectrum AI: combining GenAI agents with traditional ML models (classification, prediction, simulation) in a coordinated workflow with human-in-the-loop quality assurance.

### Agent Composition

| Agent | Function | Inputs | Outputs | ML Integration |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Data Ingestion Agent** | Collects, normalizes, and validates process data from multiple sources | Client documents, system exports, interview transcripts | Structured data repository, data quality report | Data classification for auto-categorization |
| **Process Mining Agent** | Analyzes process flows, identifies patterns, bottlenecks, and variations | Structured process data, event logs | Process maps, variation analysis, bottleneck identification | Clustering for pattern detection; anomaly detection |
| **Analysis Agent** | Performs root cause analysis, benchmarking, and opportunity quantification | Process maps, industry benchmarks, SSA methodologies | Quantified findings, opportunity sizing, priority ranking | Predictive models for impact estimation |
| **Recommendation Agent** | Generates optimization recommendations aligned with client objectives | Analysis outputs, client constraints, best practices | Prioritized recommendations, implementation considerations | Simulation for scenario modeling; classification for prioritization |
| **Output Generation Agent** | Creates client-ready deliverables in SSA formats | All upstream outputs, deliverable templates | Draft presentations, reports, executive summaries | — |

### Multi-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Data Collection & Preparation**
- Data Ingestion Agent processes uploaded documents and structured data
- *ML: Classification models auto-categorize data types and quality levels*
- Human checkpoint: Validate data completeness and quality

**Step 2: Process Discovery**
- Process Mining Agent generates as-is process maps and identifies variations
- *ML: Clustering algorithms detect process patterns; anomaly detection flags outliers*
- Human checkpoint: Review process maps for accuracy; confirm scope

**Step 3: Analysis & Quantification**
- Analysis Agent performs benchmarking, root cause analysis, opportunity sizing
- *ML: Predictive models estimate improvement impact; regression quantifies drivers*
- Human checkpoint: Validate assumptions; refine opportunity estimates

**Step 4: Recommendation Development**
- Recommendation Agent generates prioritized improvement opportunities
- *ML: Monte Carlo simulation models implementation scenarios; classification prioritizes by feasibility*
- Human checkpoint: Review recommendations against client context and constraints

**Step 5: Deliverable Generation**
- Output Generation Agent creates draft client deliverables
- Human checkpoint: Final quality review; refinement for client presentation

### Inter-Agent Communication

- **State Management:** Centralized state store maintains workflow context across agent handoffs
- **Handoff Protocol:** Structured JSON payloads with schema validation at each transition
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with human escalation for unrecoverable errors
- **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of agent decisions and outputs for quality assurance

### Human-in-the-Loop Design Principles

1. **Transparency:** Every agent output includes confidence scores and reasoning chains
2. **Override Capability:** Consultants can modify, reject, or redirect agent outputs at any checkpoint
3. **Learning Loop:** Human corrections feed back to improve agent prompts and calibration
4. **Accountability:** Final deliverables always require human sign-off before client delivery
